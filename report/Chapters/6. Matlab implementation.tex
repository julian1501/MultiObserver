\section{Matlab implementation}
Both CMOs and the SSMO as defined in Subsections \ref{subsec:CMO-architecture} and \ref{subsec:ssmo-architecture} have been implemented in Matlab. In this chapter the implementations will be discussed and the MOs will be applied on the mass-spring-damper system as described in Chapter \ref{ch:system-definition}.
